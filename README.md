# DeleteHunger üç≤

Welcome to DeleteHunger, where we're on a mission to fight food waste and hunger through technology and community collaboration.

## About
DeleteHunger is a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing food insecurity by connecting surplus food resources with those in need. Through our platform, we aim to bridge the gap between food donors and recipients, ensuring that excess food is redistributed to individuals and organizations facing hunger.

## How it Works
- **Food Donation**: Businesses, events, and individuals can donate surplus food through our platform, specifying the type and quantity of food available.
- **Food Redistribution**: We coordinate with local charities, food banks, and community organizations to distribute donated food to those in need, ensuring equitable access to nutritious meals.
- **Community Engagement**: We engage with volunteers, partners, and supporters to raise awareness about food waste and hunger, mobilizing collective action to address these issues.

## Get Involved
